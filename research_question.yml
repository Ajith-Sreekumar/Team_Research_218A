# Write your general topic.  
topic: Turkey Earthquake Data (1994 - 2023)

# Write your research question, following one of the three allowed templates.
# Be sure your question is all on one line.
RQ: Is there a correlation between the earthquake magnitude on the Richter scale ('ML') and the depth of the earthquake ('Der(km)')?

# Write your independent and dependent variables.  These should be the
# column names (reported by R colnames() where these variables are
# found in your dataset's CSV file.
# Note: if your question is about comparison of means, medians, or
# proportions, the independent variable column is the one that
# contains the values (at least two) that divide the population into
# subsets.
independent-var: Earthquake magnitude ('ML')
dependent-var: Depth ('Der(km)')

# Write the null hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
null-hypothesis: There is no correlation between earthquake magnitude on the Richter scale and earthquake depth.

# Write the alternative hypothesis for your research question, again ensuring it is all on one line.
alt-hypothesis: There is a correlation between earthquake magnitude on the Richter scale and earthquake depth.

# Write the dataset ID (KNNN):
dataset-id: DS023

# Write the dataset URL.  
dataset-url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ozgecinko/turkey-earthquake-data-1914-2023

# Write the dataset CSV filename, exactly as it appears on the Sharepoint list
# (which should be the same as the one in your repository!)

# Paste the output of loading your dataset into R, and executing the
